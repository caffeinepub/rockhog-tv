  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all core requirements for the live chat room feature. Backend data structures (ChatRoom, ChatMessage) are defined and integrated into persistent storage. Backend methods (createChatRoom, getAllChatRooms, getChatRoomMessages, postMessage) are implemented. React Query hooks are created with polling (2.5s interval). The ChatRoomPage component includes a sidebar, message list, ChatInput integration, auto-scroll, and login prompt. Routing and navigation are properly configured. A unique chat room theme is defined. A default 'RockHog Lounge' room is initialized via migration. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the available diff evidence.",
